# Exercise: Number Guessing Game #
 
Write a Python program where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess it.

## Requirements ##
- Use the `random` module to generate a number.
- Use a loop to let the user keep guessing until they get it right.
- If the guess is too high, print `"Too high! Try again."`
- If the guess is too low, print `"Too low! Try again."`
- When guessed correctly, print `"Congratulations! You guessed it in X tries."`

### Example Output ###
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 30
Think Low! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 15
Think High! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 20
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 tries.
